    <td width="300" valign = "top">
<p> I am a 3-year student of BSUIR, studying at the Faculty of Information Technologies and Control.
My specialty is Automated Information Processing Systems. 
There I try to work hard and achieve my goals. 
But the university is not a limit. 
To be successful, you need work on yourself efficiently. 
So, I’m here, doing self-education and trying to break into an adult world.
 After all, dedication is a way to success! </p>

		I have mathematical thinking, but I am literate and creative at the same time.</p>

	<h2><strong>Interests</strong></h2>
<p>My personal interests include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Painting. I adore watercolor painting, but now I haven’t got enough time to it.
		 But in summer I like drawing in nature. I find it gorgeous to paint native landscapes.</li>
		<li>Reading a lot. I prefer fiction, but I’m also interested in non-fiction, educational and developing literature.</li>
		<li>Active participation in university life. I suppose that It is very important to spend your time at university as brightly as possible, 
		because it is an integral step between your childhood and adult life.</li>
